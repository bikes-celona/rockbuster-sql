This is a SQL query with subqueries:
SELECT A.country, COUNT(DISTINCT D.customer_id) AS all_customer_count, COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM country A
INNER JOIN city B ON A.country_id = B.country_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN customer D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
LEFT JOIN
(SELECT D.customer_id, D.first_name,
D.last_name,
A.country,
B.city,
SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount_paid FROM country A
INNER JOIN city B ON A.country_id = B.country_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN customer D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON D.customer_id = E.customer_id WHERE B.city IN ('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights','Iwaki','Ambattur','Shanwei','S o Leopoldo','Teboksary','Tianjin','Cianjur' )
GROUP BY D.customer_id, A.country, B.city
LIMIT 5) AS top_5_customers
ON A.country = top_5_customers.country
GROUP BY A.country, top_5_customers.customer_id
ORDER BY top_customer_count DESC
