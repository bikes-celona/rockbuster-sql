Here is SQL query with joins:
SELECT A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, E.country, D.city, SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights','Iwaki','Ambattur','Shanwei','So Leopoldo','Teboksary','Tianjin','Cianjur')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
